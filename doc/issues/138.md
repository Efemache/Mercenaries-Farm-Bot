# Mercenaries not attacking
The issue was that it would queue into the selected bounty and just keep passing turns until I'd lose, then queue again.

I resolved it by doing the following (Hearthstone should **not** be on for this): 

1. Making sure everything was done correctly in the [FAQ section that discusses this](https://github.com/Efemache/Mercenaries-Farm-bot/tree/main/doc/FAQ.md#mercenaries-dont-attack).
2. Checking the Hearthstone installation folder and setting both executables (Hearthstone Beta Launcher.exe and Hearthstone.exe) to run as admin ([windows] done via right click->properties->compatibility tab->run as admin).
3. Checking the zone.log file in the Hearthstone folder wasn't set to read-only (Hearthstone installation folder\Logs folder. Right click the file and click properties. Make sure "read-only" is not checked).

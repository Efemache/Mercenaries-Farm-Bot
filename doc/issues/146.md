# Mercenaries don't attack during battle

It happens to some users because something is misconfigured. Here, find how you can solve the problem:

1. make sure you followed [instruction about log.config](https://github.com/Efemache/Mercenaries-Farm-bot/tree/main/doc/settings.md#logconfig)
2. without using MFB, start a battle and check *\<GameDir\>\Logs\Zone.log* is filled (if yes, it should work with MFB)
3. check your *log.config* is named *log.config* and not *log.config.txt*   
:warning: windows users: check right clicking on the file, looking into properties and confirm it's not a TXT file; see pictures below

4. check *log.config* is put in the right directory (re-read [instructions](https://github.com/Efemache/Mercenaries-Farm-bot/tree/main/doc/settings.md#logconfig) about it)
5. restart Hearthstone or even your PC
5. if it doesn't work, try to start **Hearthstone as admin** (as described here [#138](https://github.com/Efemache/Mercenaries-Farm-bot/tree/main/doc/issues/138.md)) **or MFB as admin**  
:warning: for some users, MFB doesn't work with HS started as admin

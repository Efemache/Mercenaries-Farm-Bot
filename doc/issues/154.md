# Decode error at the start of battle
## UnicodeDecodeError: 'cp949' codec can't decode byte 0xed in position 3430: illegal multibyte sequence

The encoding for korean microsoft softwares are initially set to cp949. However there were a few letters this encoder couldn't handle.

### My way to solve this issue was to change windows default windows settings. 

1. Control Panel / Region.(제어판 / 날짜, 시간)

2. Administrative tab / Change system locale (관리자 / 시스템 로캘 변경)

3. Check Beta: Use UTF-8 for worldwide language support. (베타 세계 언어 지원을 위한 유니코드  uft-8사용 클릭)

### Other way was to re-encode some files

encode all json files at \conf\system with ANSI

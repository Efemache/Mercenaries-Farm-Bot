# Free & Tip: 2 ways starting 2022-11-07
<details><summary>Click here if you want some context</summary>

## Context
* I started to actively work on this bot (november 2021) because **I thought doing it open source, some devs would come** too to improve MFB so it would be a win/win
* Too few devs came (**big thanks to those who participated**) and they, generally, added a feature or two or fixed a bug but none staied on a long term or to globally help
* A lot of users asked for : features, doc update, videos, bugs fix (a lot of them didn't even impact me), help because they misconfigured MFB, help on their setup which wasn't even offically supported and I helped each time I could :
  * **Only 4 people made a donation**
  * A donation is like "Great job" or "Hey, you helped me, thanks, let me buy you a beer or a coffee" (especially when I spent 1 hour or more to help someone)
* Finally, it was way too much work for me "alone" and a lose/win for me

## In conclusion 
</details>

To continue to work on and maintain the bot : 
* MFB remains **free and open source** but updates will be **delivered 3-4 weeks later**
* For those who **help** (in coding) **and** those who **[give a tip](#if-you-want-to-support-or-thank-us) (at least 10$)**, updates will be **delivered 3-4 weeks before others**

 **Pull Request are still accepted**: if you have a bug or want a new feature, code it if you know how-to do it and send a PR.

> **Note**:  
> Look at the [changelog](https://ko-fi.com/mercenariesfarm/posts) to see what is already available in the supporters version and release dates for github.

# Dev progress

## Language & resolution
‚ö†Ô∏è 1920x1080 is the only resolution "officially supported" (meaning, I can only test this resolution) but the other mentionned resolutions work too

‚ö†Ô∏è windowed : monitor needs to have a higher resolution than Hearthstone for both width AND height

| Resolution | English |
| :------------------- | :-------------:|
| 1920x1080 fullscreen <sup>1</sup> |        ‚úÖ      |
| 1920x1080 windowed  |        ‚úÖ      |
|  16:9 fullscreen  <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> |        ‚úÖ      |
|  16:9 windowed  <sup>2</sup> |        ‚úÖ      |

(1)
* *for fullscreen mode, Hearthstone resolution and screen resolution need to be the same (example : 1920x1080 for both)*

(2)
* *16:9 resolution should work if at least 960x540 (960x540, 1024x576, 1280x720, 1600x900, ...)*
* *higher (than 1920x1080) 16:9 resolution has been tested with 2560x1440*
